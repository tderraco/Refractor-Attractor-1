# refractor-attractor

## In this refactoring assignment I cleaned up a lot of the <div> classes. I replaced them with <section> tags. I added a <section id> tag to line 29. Replaced the <div> with <footer> tag on line 74 and 79. I reassigned classes in order to condense the CSS. 

## I learned quite a bit from this assignment. I think the number one thing I learned was to have a more confidence in what I have learned. Second I learned not to use too many <div> classes as that may make your code look messy. I learned how to link my HTML to my CSS. I also learned how to consolidate my code so that I am not repeating the same things.
